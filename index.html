			<p>This is the Vallée d'Ossau, hence my nickname. This is a beautiful protected space where i often go to hike. This is an easy and peaceful place, with numerous breathtaking views. From a couple hours to several days, you can hike as long as you want here, there is a refuge named Ayous where you can sleep, but not for free.<br />

			<p>The climate is temperate. Around -10°c in a cold winter to 35°c in summer and higher is colder, it's important to have the right equipment if you don't want to die of hypothermia or hyperthermia. Happily, France is a huge manufacturer of good sleepings bags, like <a href="http://triplezero.fr">Triple Zero</a>.<br /></p>
